This repo contains a basic data exploration exercise carried out in Python using a Jupyter (IPython) Notebook.

The data pertains to the Health Insurance Market Place under the Affordble Healthcare Act and can be downloaded from the Kaggle website [https://www.kaggle.com/hhsgov/health-insurance-marketplace]

If you have Jupyter installed on your machine, then `cd` to the directory where you downloaded the `healthInsuranceExplore.ipynb`, and make sure you have the data downloaded in this directory as well. Then run `jupyter notebook healthInsuranceExplore.ipynb` in the terminal to open the notebook in your web browser. Alternatively, you can download the `.html` file and open it in your browser to read over the notebook, you just won't be able to run any code.
